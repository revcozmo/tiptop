# TipTop

Hi, every one. Please don't mind, but I'm not planing to edit a proper README.
What you are seeing here is an ionic application designed as a little game providing you with small riddles for boring moments.

The reason why I'm not editing a proper README is simple. I'm still student and have only little time for coding. So I have no time for a description, explanation or something else. Maybe I'll add a helpfull README in the (distant?) future.

If you wonder what it does exactly. Try it out; you'll need cordova-icon and cordova-splash. There two scripts in hooks/after_prepare for cordova-icon and cordova-splash which are executed when app is build. They'll probably only run on linux. So if you don't have that, delete or change them.(They're just two lines long.)
I only tested it on android so far.

Good Luck
